This library does only depend on Android and OpenGL

Abstractions for drawing different OpenGL elements
-colored geometry (GLProgramVC) = GLProgramVertexColor
-textured geometry
        -using a "external texture" OpenGL sampler (GLProgramTextureExt)
-text btw. strings in 3D OpenGL space (GLProgramText), sampling from a TextAtlas texture.
Supports antialiased edges even without MSAA enabled
-Lines with variable width (independent from glLineWidth)
Also antialiased without MSAA


All vertex fragment shaders are stored in the header files.
FS means fragment shader, VS means vertex shader
They all support vertex displacement distortion correction

They should be created using a shared_ptr in onSurfaceCreated()
